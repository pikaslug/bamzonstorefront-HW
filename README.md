# Node.js & MySQL Amazon Storefront

An Amazon-like storefront CLI app using Node.js & MySQL



### Overview
This is an example project commonly used in coding bootcamps run by [Trilogy Education Services] (https://www.trilogyed.com/) (UC Berkeley Extension, Rutgers, UCLA Extension, Columbia Engineering, Penn etc). You are free to use this repo to help you understand your assignment. No credit needed. Just learn the process for yourself along the way!

## Project Scope

This project is to create an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL & Node.js. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

As a bonus task, we will program the app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
